# apogee-vm

A RISC-V zkVM proving RV32IMAC guest programs, arithmetized as GKR circuit families
over the BN254 scalar field Fr, proven with gate-based sumcheck, committed with the
Mercury multilinear PCS, transcripted with Poseidon2. No FRI anywhere. The full
specification, the frozen protocol invariants, the effort budget and the anti-goals
live in `prompts/00-master.md` — **read it before writing code**, along with the stage
prompt you are working on.

are frozen; internals are not.

## Build stage protocol
Read `prompts/00-master.md`, then the stage prompt, then every prior note in
`docs/handoff/`. Branch off `main`, commit on the branch, open a PR, and finish by
writing `docs/handoff/<stage>.md` and updating this file. Raise conflicts and
open questions with the user rather than picking a default silently.

## Commands
Everything above the line is what CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); a green local
run of these is a green CI run.

`tools/transcript-ref` is deliberately outside the cargo workspace, so it takes
`--manifest-path` rather than `-p`. Its Plonky3 and `zkhash` dependencies would otherwise
feature-unify `serde/std` into `crates/field` during `cargo test --workspace`.
The toolchain, its components and the guest target come from `rust-toolchain.toml`. CI
does not name a version anywhere, so it cannot drift from that pin.

## The rules that bite most often
- **Concrete types.** `Fr` is a struct. There is no `F: Field`, and there never will be.
- **No cargo features. Zero.** One build configuration for the whole workspace.
- **One encoding.** Field elements on the wire are canonical (non-Montgomery) 32-byte
  little-endian. Montgomery form exists only in memory. Source literals are the one
  exception and are their own single form: `Fr::from_hex`, `0x` plus 64 lowercase digits,
  big-endian, because a constant in source is a number and should diff against upstream.
- **Fq is not Fr.** `Fr` is the scalar field everything is arithmetized over; `Fq` is the
  base field curve coordinates live in. The moduli agree in their top 128 bits. `curve::Fq`
  is a deliberate literal duplicate of `field::Fr`'s Montgomery kernel, not an abstraction
  over it, and `curve::g2` is a literal mirror of `curve::g1`.
- **The pairing is the exact power.** `final_exponentiation` returns `f^((q^12-1)/r)` and
  never a fixed multiple of it, so the Fuentes-Castañeda hard part is out — which also
  means arkworks' own `Bn254::pairing` is *not* a drop-in oracle, and the fixtures raise
  its Miller output to the literal exponent instead.
- **Points on the wire are uncompressed affine.** 64 bytes `x ‖ y` for G1, 128 bytes
  `x.c0 ‖ x.c1 ‖ y.c0 ‖ y.c1` for G2, each coordinate canonical 32-byte LE, all-zero for
  infinity. No compressed form, no decompression, ever. A point's *transcript* form is a
  different thing: four ~128-bit Fr limbs. Those limbs are frozen in S08: `x` low,
  `x` high, `y` low, `y` high, split at 128 bits, with infinity absorbing four copies of
  `constants::G1_INFINITY_SENTINEL` = `2^128` — a value no real limb can take.
  `pcs::append_g1_list` is **one** message of `4k` limbs, never `k` messages.
- **One index convention.** Variable `j` is bit `j`: the evaluation at `y` sits at
  `index = sum_j y_j 2^j`, and `bind` fixes variable 0, the low bit. Frozen in
  `crates/poly` and load-bearing for every later circuit stage. Sumcheck round `i`
  binds variable `i`, so a claim's point reads in that same order.
- **`u1` is the FIRST half of a Mercury opening point.** `n = 2^{2t}`, `b = 2^t`, and the
  evaluation at index `i + j·b` is the coefficient of `X^{i+j·b}` with `i` the low `t`
  bits. `u1 = u_0..u_{t-1}` pairs with `i`; `u2` pairs with `j`. This is the #1
  integration bug and the verifier rejects a swapped pair. `docs/spec/mercury.md` §2.
- **A Mercury commitment IS a plain KZG commitment** of the evaluation table read as
  coefficients — exact equality, no second scheme. Trace heights are *even* powers of two
  so that `b = sqrt(n)` exists, which is where the height menu comes from.
- **Fixed proof shapes.** A sumcheck round message is 4 coefficients, always — the
  degree ceiling makes the round polynomial a cubic, and nothing in a proof has a
  data-dependent length.
- **One tag, one message kind.** The transcript frames typed messages as
  `tag, length, payload`, so a tag in `constants::transcript_tags` must name exactly one
  of scalars, bytes or a challenge. Reusing one across kinds is a soundness bug.
- **The ceremony is PSE's, not Hermez's.** `ppot_0080_<power>.ptau` from PSE's perpetual
  powers of tau, contribution 80, and nothing else. Hermez's `powersOfTau28_hez_final_*`
  is a *different ceremony with a different `tau`*: the two are not interchangeable, and
  swapping one in silently gives a correct-looking SRS whose committed fixtures do not
  match. `docs/spec/srs.md` §2.0.
- **`.ptau` points are little-endian *Montgomery*.** The one file format here that is
  not canonical: a ceremony file stores `coord * R mod q`, because that is
  ffjavascript's in-memory layout written straight out. `crates/srs` multiplies by
  `R^-1` and hands canonical bytes to S05's `from_bytes`, so there is still exactly one
  validating decoder.
- **SRS integrity is presumed; there is no SRS digest.** S07's Poseidon2 digest over the
  SRS was dropped on instruction, so the master's statement-binding item `SRS digest`
  has no implementation and nothing binds a proof to a particular SRS. Read
  `docs/spec/srs.md` §4 before building statement binding.
- **Own the crypto.** Runtime dependencies are limited to serialization, rayon, CLI and
  error handling. arkworks, Plonky3 and `zkhash` are reference oracles for tests and
  fixtures only, and never reachable from the prover, the verifier or a guest.
- **No `unsafe`, no nightly, no async, no threads.** Parallelism is rayon over data.
- **Boring beats clever.** Added surface area is a defect. Every verifier entry point is
  `(&VerifyingKey, &Proof, &PublicInputs)` and nothing else.
